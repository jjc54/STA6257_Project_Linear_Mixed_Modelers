title: "The Linear Mixed Modelers"
---

Linear mixed models (LMMs) are statistical models that account for both fixed and random effects. In this report, we provided a systematic review of LMMs, their applications, their limitations, and more. Importantly, we developed this report and **by-example** analysis of LMMs in R.

As part of **Advanced Statistical Modeling (STA 6257) at the University of West Florida**, our team critically analyzed, assessed, and produced a LMM and elaborated on potential applications in a professional report. This website was built using R/Quarto as was the entire project.

This project was completed under the guidance of **Dr. Ahcraf Cohen ([Achraf Cohen \| Dr. Achraf Cohen](https://pages.uwf.edu/acohen/index.html)).**

Here's a snapshot of the capstone project:

Feel free to meet our team, **The Linear Mixed Modelers**, on the **About** tab and review our individual literature contributions on the **Literature** tab. Our overall report is on the **Report** tab with slides and poster presentation extracted for general use.
