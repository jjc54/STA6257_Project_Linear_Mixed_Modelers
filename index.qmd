title: "The Linear Mixed Modelers"
---

Linear mixed models (LMMs) are statistical models that account for both fixed and random effects. Please follow along as we provide a systematic review of LMMs, their applications, their limitations, and more. Importantly, we will develop a report and **by-example** analysis of LMMs in R.

Here's a snapshot of the analysis process our team is currently going through:

Feel free to meet our team, **The Linear Mixed Modelers**, on the **About** tab and review our individual literature contributions on the **Literature** tab. Our overall report is on the **Report** tab with code and slides extracted for general use.
