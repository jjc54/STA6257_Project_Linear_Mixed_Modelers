The paper aims to clarify the use of GLMMs, given the popularity of these models in recent years.\nWhy is it important?\nThe importance of this paper lies in its attempt to introduce GLMMs for biologists, where data often fall outside the scope of methods taught in introductory statistics classes. The paper highlights the limitations of traditional shortcuts like data transformation or ignoring random effects and advocates for GLMMs as a more appropriate statistical approach for nonnormal data with random effects.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThe paper reviews the use and misuse of GLMMs in biology, discusses estimation and inference, and summarizes best-practice data analysis procedures. It emphasizes the need for researchers to match their statistical approaches to their data, rather than forcing data into classical statistical frameworks. The paper discusses various estimation algorithms for fitting GLMMs, including maximum likelihood (ML), pseudo- and penalized quasilikelihood (PQL), Laplace approximations, Gauss-Hermite quadrature (GHQ), and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nWhile the paper provides a broad overview of GLMM procedures and best practices, it also acknowledges the challenges and controversies in statistical issues such as null hypothesis testing, stepwise regression, and the use of Bayesian statistics. It highlights that GLMMs are powerful tools but can be challenging to use, even for statisticians, due to computational difficulties in estimating parameters, especially for complex models or large numbers of random effects.\n\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of this paper is to introduce linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) as a versatile tool for analyzing data from within-participant psychology experiments. It seeks to address the limitations of traditional analysis methods like ANOVA in handling complex data structures, such as those involving repeated measures or nested designs. The paper also introduces LMMgui, a free, graphical user interface designed to facilitate the use of LMMs for researchers using R.\nWhy is it important?\nThe importance of this work lies in its potential to enhance the analysis of experimental psychology data by providing a more flexible and robust statistical tool that can handle the complexities of within-participant designs, such as pseudoreplication and missing data. By offering a user-friendly interface for LMM analysis, the paper aims to make advanced statistical methods more accessible to researchers, thereby improving the quality and interpretability of psychological research.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThe paper discusses the theoretical foundation of LMMs, explaining how they can accommodate various data structures and assumptions that are commonly encountered in psychology experiments. It contrasts LMMs with traditional repeated-measures ANOVA, highlighting the advantages of LMMs in terms of their flexibility and fewer stringent assumptions. The introduction of LMMgui is a significant methodological contribution, providing a step-by-step guide on how to use this tool to specify and compare different LMMs for data analysis.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nWhile the paper primarily serves as a tutorial and does not present results from a specific study, it effectively demonstrates the application of LMMs through hypothetical examples. These examples illustrate how LMMs can be used to analyze data from within-participant designs, accounting for random effects and complex variance-covariance structures. The paper acknowledges the challenges in interpreting LMM results and the potential for increased Type I error rates in certain conditions, emphasizing the need for careful model comparison and validation.\n\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of this paper is to estimate baseline mortality (mortality under non-pandemic conditions for Belgium and the Netherlands using a linear mixed model (LMM), which can account for both fixed and random effects. If baseline mortality can be modeled, then excess mortality (the measure of the increase in mortality from all causes during a specific time period) can be used to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on mortality.\nWhy is it important?\nHistorically, 5-year weekly averages have been used to determine baseline mortality. However, this excludes year-specific trends in mortality and the effects of historical excess mortality (ex: past influenza breakouts or heat waves). Using a LMM is important because it allows for more accurate modeling that accounts for these factors in the form of random effects.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThe paper proposes a general linear mixed model to model weekly mortality as Ytj, with t = 1,…,52 weeks and by year j = 2009…,2020.\nThe model is then adjusted to: model the cyclic pattern from year to year via random effects of Fourier terms, and reduce the influence of historical excess mortality (as mentioned above) by downweighing the residuals.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nSeveral statistics were used to evaluate the model’s forecasting accuracy, including the likelihood ratio test (LRT) and the root mean square error % (RMSE%). The models were fitted to historical mortality year from 2009- week 10 of 2020. The remaining 42 weeks of 2020 were forecasted using the LMM, along with the 5-year average model, and the ground truth data. The models all performed well, so an overall recommendation to include the down-weight procedure for past excess mortality and to include a serial correlation structure were made. The LMM did fit the mortality data better and two years were better predicted compared to the 5-year weekly average models. Many limitations exist, including differences in the reporting of COVID-19 deaths in Belgium and the Netherlands, and across the world. Additionally, it is unclear if the added complexity of LMMs provide a significant benefit over 5-year weekly average models in years besides 2014 and 2016.\n\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of this paper is to address a potential shortcoming of LMMs, which is when data is not missing at random, but instead, data is missing that is dependent on the health-related quality-of-life of the patient (i.e., data is missing because quality-of-life – the outcome - decreased). Viewing missing data like this, a survival model may be more appropriate. Or, as this paper suggests, a joint model (JM) that includes both LMM and survival sub-models.\nWhy is it important?\nThis concept is important because clinical trials are frequently employing LMMs to evaluate longitudinal data. Clinical trials involve human subjects, which are known to be more variable compared to benchtop studies. This includes variation in the completeness of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), especially for longitudinal studies. Many times, this variation is random, and independent of the outcome measure. However, if the outcome measure itself is having an effect on the completeness, then it could represent a major bias limitation of LMMs that should be addressed using the proposed joint models.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThis paper first introduces the LMM that is traditional in longitudinal clinical studies like this. Then, to account for the fact that observations in quality-of-life scores ends with a dropout event, a joint model is created by linking the LMM to a survival model with shared parameters.\nThis JM was then evaluated using historical clinical trial data where a standard LMM was utilized, and in several simulation studies where extreme examples of this dependence was introduced.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nThis paper showed that poor quality-of-life scores are associated with drop out. Therefore, LMMs should be avoided when analyzing this data in clinical trials. The LMMs in both the historical studies and in the simulations were overly optimistic in estimating the quality-of-life scores. Specifically, the LMM overestimates the slope governing the prediction trajectory in both treatment and control arms. The LMM is also more optimistic for the control arm than the experimental arm, despite the protective effect of treatment on the quality-of-life score."
