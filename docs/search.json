    "text": "1 Introduction\nLinear mixed-effects models (LMMs) have emerged as a powerful statistical tool for analyzing data that violate the assumptions of traditional ANOVA or regression methods, particularly in the presence of intra-subject differences, hierarchical data structures, and non-independence of observations. This introduction synthesizes the findings from a series of papers that explore the application, advantages, and limitations of LMMs across various fields including psychology, ecology, evolution, and medical research.\nOne article by Brown Et. Al. underscores the utility of LMMs in handling complex data structures, such as those encountered in psychological research, by providing a detailed walkthrough of LME model syntax in R without delving deeply into the mathematical underpinnings of LMMs [Brown (2021)]. The flexibility of LMMs with missing values and outliers is particularly emphasized, highlighting their suitability for psychological research where within-subject differences are prevalent.\nIn the realm of ecology, the application of LMMs extends to addressing challenges related to error and model selection in ecological research. Harrison Et. Al. provide a comprehensive overview of LMMs in ecological data analysis, focusing on information theory and multi-model inference, thereby underscoring the broad applicability of LMMs in handling ecological datasets [Harrison et al. (2018)].\nGeneralized linear mixed models (GLMMs) further extend the utility of LMMs to nonnormal data types, such as counts or proportions, commonly encountered in ecology and evolution. Bolker Et. Al. highlight the limitations of traditional statistical methods and advocate for GLMMs as a more appropriate approach, emphasizing the need for researchers to match their statistical methods to their data [Bolker et al. (2009)].\nThe introduction of user-friendly tools such as LMMgui further democratizes the use of LMMs among researchers with limited statistical expertise, such as medical doctors. Magezi presents LMMgui, a graphical user interface that facilitates the use of LMMs in analyzing data from within-participant psychology experiments, thereby enhancing the accessibility of advanced statistical methods [Magezi (2015)].\nIn the context of medical research specifically, LMMs have been employed to estimate COVID-19-induced excess mortality, demonstrating their capability to model baseline mortality and account for year-specific trends and historical excess mortality events. Verbeeck Et. Al. underscore the adaptability of LMMs in modeling complex phenomena such as pandemic-induced mortality changes [Verbeeck et al. (2023)].\nFurthermore, the comparison between LMMs and joint models in analyzing longitudinal health-related quality of life data in cancer clinical trials reveals the potential limitations of LMMs when data is not missing at random (MAR). Touraine Et. Al. highlight the importance of choosing the appropriate model based on the nature of the missing data, advocating for joint models in specific scenarios [Touraine et al. (2023)].\nThe literature reviews collectively emphasize the versatility, robustness, and broad applicability of LMMs and GLMMs across various fields of research. Despite their advantages, the importance of careful model selection, acknowledgment of limitations, and the potential need for more complex models such as joint models in certain scenarios are also highlighted. As the use of LMMs continues to grow, the development of standardized processes and user-friendly tools will be crucial in ensuring the accurate and effective application of these models in research.\n\nReferences\n\n\nBolker, B.

The introduction of LMMgui is a significant methodological contribution, providing a step-by-step guide on how to use this tool to specify and compare different LMMs for data analysis.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nWhile the paper primarily serves as a tutorial and does not present results from a specific study, it effectively demonstrates the application of LMMs through hypothetical examples. These examples illustrate how LMMs can be used to analyze data from within-participant designs, accounting for random effects and complex variance-covariance structures. The paper acknowledges the challenges in interpreting LMM results and the potential for increased Type I error rates in certain conditions, emphasizing the need for careful model comparison and validation.\n\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of this paper is to estimate baseline mortality (mortality under non-pandemic conditions for Belgium and the Netherlands using a linear mixed model (LMM), which can account for both fixed and random effects. If baseline mortality can be modeled, then excess mortality (the measure of the increase in mortality from all causes during a specific time period) can be used to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on mortality.\nWhy is it important?\nHistorically, 5-year weekly averages have been used to determine baseline mortality. However, this excludes year-specific trends in mortality and the effects of historical excess mortality (ex: past influenza breakouts or heat waves). Using a LMM is important because it allows for more accurate modeling that accounts for these factors in the form of random effects.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThe paper proposes a general linear mixed model to model weekly mortality as Ytj, with t = 1,…,52 weeks and by year j = 2009…,2020.\nThe model is then adjusted to: model the cyclic pattern from year to year via random effects of Fourier terms, and reduce the influence of historical excess mortality (as mentioned above) by downweighing the residuals.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nSeveral statistics were used to evaluate the model’s forecasting accuracy, including the likelihood ratio test (LRT) and the root mean square error % (RMSE%). The models were fitted to historical mortality year from 2009- week 10 of 2020. The remaining 42 weeks of 2020 were forecasted using the LMM, along with the 5-year average model, and the ground truth data. The models all performed well, so an overall recommendation to include the down-weight procedure for past excess mortality and to include a serial correlation structure were made. The LMM did fit the mortality data better and two years were better predicted compared to the 5-year weekly average models. Many limitations exist, including differences in the reporting of COVID-19 deaths in Belgium and the Netherlands, and across the world. Additionally, it is unclear if the added complexity of LMMs provide a significant benefit over 5-year weekly average models in years besides 2014 and 2016.\n\n\n\nWhat is the goal of the paper?\nThe goal of this paper is to address a potential shortcoming of LMMs, which is when data is not missing at random, but instead, data is missing that is dependent on the health-related quality-of-life of the patient (i.e., data is missing because quality-of-life – the outcome - decreased). Viewing missing data like this, a survival model may be more appropriate. Or, as this paper suggests, a joint model (JM) that includes both LMM and survival sub-models.\nWhy is it important?\nThis concept is important because clinical trials are frequently employing LMMs to evaluate longitudinal data. Clinical trials involve human subjects, which are known to be more variable compared to benchtop studies. This includes variation in the completeness of patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), especially for longitudinal studies. Many times, this variation is random, and independent of the outcome measure. However, if the outcome measure itself is having an effect on the completeness, then it could represent a major bias limitation of LMMs that should be addressed using the proposed joint models.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThis paper first introduces the LMM that is traditional in longitudinal clinical studies like this. Then, to account for the fact that observations in quality-of-life scores ends with a dropout event, a joint model is created by linking the LMM to a survival model with shared parameters.\nThis JM was then evaluated using historical clinical trial data where a standard LMM was utilized, and in several simulation studies where extreme examples of this dependence was introduced.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nThis paper showed that poor quality-of-life scores are associated with drop out. Therefore, LMMs should be avoided when analyzing this data in clinical trials. The LMMs in both the historical studies and in the simulations were overly optimistic in estimating the quality-of-life scores. Specifically, the LMM overestimates the slope governing the prediction trajectory in both treatment and control arms. The LMM is also more optimistic for the control arm than the experimental arm, despite the protective effect of treatment on the quality-of-life score."

Non independence can happen when data is hierarchical in structure resulting in correlations within groups in the data sets resulting in the violation of the assumption of independence between observations. The example provided has a sample dataset with different patient observations belonging to multiple doctors.\nWhy is it important?\nGoing on the aforementioned example, data can be averaged on a doctor group level but his would result in less data. And you can not make inferences about an individual patient. You can also do multiple linear models for each doctor but the models themselve have less data resulting in more noise.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nLinear Mixed models find a trade off between both approaches where the random effects are still considered for each doctor but there is still an overall grand or fixed effect.\nResults/limitations, if any.\nThere was no dataset or experiment analyzed in this paper.

Different covariance structures were modeled within the LMM to capture correlated data through time.\nWhy is it important?\nGrowth curves in children are usually represented as a 2 level data structure. At level 2 is the individual child and at the second level is each individual observation. Traditional linear models are not effective due to the non-independence of the data.\nHow is it solved? – methods\nThe simulation study found that the UN covariance performed the best although it suffered from efficiency because of the high number of parameters leaving the ARH(1) as a solid alternative. The data was also not naturally collected but simulated\nResults/limitations, if any.\nThe simulation study found that the UN covariance performed the best although it suffered from efficiency because of the high number of parameters leaving the ARH(1) as a solid alternative.
