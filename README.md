Linear mixed models (LMMs) are statistical models that account for both fixed and random effects. Please follow along as we provide a critical analysis of LMMs, their applications, their limitations, and more. Importantly, we will develop a by-example report and summary of LMMs to be used in R.

Here's a snapshot of the analysis process our team is currently going through:
