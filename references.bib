The intended audience is researchers who have some basic statistical knowledge, but little or no experience implementing mixed-effects models in R using their own data. In an attempt to increase the accessibility of this Tutorial, I deliberately avoid using mathematical terminology beyond what a student would learn in a standard graduate-level statistics course, but I reference articles and textbooks that provide more detail for interested readers. This Tutorial includes snippets of R code throughout; the data and R script used to build the models described in the text are available via OSF at https://osf.io/v6qag/, so readers can follow along if they wish. The goal of this practical introduction is to provide researchers with the tools they need to begin implementing mixed-effects models in their own research.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize ‘best-practice’ data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

To evaluate the impact of the pandemic on mortality, the use of excess mortality rather than reported COVID-19 deaths has been suggested. Excess mortality, however, requires estimation of mortality under nonpandemic conditions. Although many methods exist to forecast mortality, they are either complex to apply, require many sources of information, ignore serial correlation, and/or are influenced by historical excess mortality. We propose a linear mixed model that is easy to apply, requires only historical mortality data, allows for serial correlation, and down-weighs the influence of historical excess mortality. Appropriateness of the linear mixed model is evaluated with fit statistics and forecasting accuracy measures for Belgium and the Netherlands. Unlike the commonly used 5-year weekly average, the linear mixed model is forecasting the year-specific mortality, and as a result improves the estimation of excess mortality for Belgium and the Netherlands.},

	volume = {23},
	issn = {1471-2288},
	doi = {10.1186/s12874-023-01846-3},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes such as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) are increasingly used as endpoints in randomized cancer clinical trials. However, the patients often drop out so that observation of the HRQoL longitudinal outcome ends prematurely, leading to monotone missing data. The patients may drop out for various reasons including occurrence of toxicities, disease progression, or may die. In case of informative dropout, the usual linear mixed model analysis will produce biased estimates. Unbiased estimates cannot be obtained unless the dropout is jointly modeled with the longitudinal outcome, for instance by using a joint model composed of a linear mixed (sub)model linked to a survival (sub)model. Our objective was to investigate in a clinical trial context the consequences of using the most frequently used linear mixed model, the random intercept and slope model, rather than its corresponding joint model.
METHODS: We first illustrate and compare the models on data of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. We then perform a more formal comparison through a simulation study.
RESULTS: From the application, we derived hypotheses on the situations in which biases arise and on their nature. Through the simulation study, we confirmed and complemented these hypotheses and provided general explanations of the bias mechanisms.
CONCLUSIONS: In particular, this article reveals how the linear mixed model fails in the typical situation where poor HRQoL is associated with an increased risk of dropout and the experimental treatment improves survival. Unlike the joint model, in this situation the linear mixed model will overestimate the HRQoL in both arms, but not equally, misestimating the difference between the HRQoL trajectories of the two arms to the disadvantage of the experimental arm.},

In the mixed modeling framework, missing values occur naturally due to dropouts or non-responses, which is frequently encountered when dealing with real data. Motivated by such problems, we aim to investigate the estimation and model selection performance in linear mixed models when missing data are present. Inspired by the property of the indicator function for missingness and its relation to missing rates, we propose an approach that records missingness in an indicator-based matrix and derive the likelihood-based estimators for all parameters involved in the linear mixed-effects models. Based on the proposed method for estimation, we explore the relationship between estimation and selection behavior over missing rates. Simulations and a real data application are conducted for illustrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in selecting the most appropriate model and in estimating parameters.},

	abstract = {Abstract Linear mixed-effects models are powerful tools for analysing complex datasets with repeated or clustered observations, a common data structure in ecology and evolution. Mixed-effects models involve complex fitting procedures and make several assumptions, in particular about the distribution of residual and random effects. Violations of these assumptions are common in real datasets, yet it is not always clear how much these violations matter to accurate and unbiased estimation. Here we address the consequences of violations in distributional assumptions and the impact of missing random effect components on model estimates. In particular, we evaluate the effects of skewed, bimodal and heteroscedastic random effect and residual variances, of missing random effect terms and of correlated fixed effect predictors. We focus on bias and prediction error on estimates of fixed and random effects. Model estimates were usually robust to violations of assumptions, with the exception of slight upward biases in estimates of random effect variance if the generating distribution was bimodal but was modelled by Gaussian error distributions. Further, estimates for (random effect) components that violated distributional assumptions became less precise but remained unbiased. However, this particular problem did not affect other parameters of the model. The same pattern was found for strongly correlated fixed effects, which led to imprecise, but unbiased estimates, with uncertainty estimates reflecting imprecision. Unmodelled sources of random effect variance had predictable effects on variance component estimates. The pattern is best viewed as a cascade of hierarchical grouping factors. Variances trickle down the hierarchy such that missing higher-level random effect variances pool at lower levels and missing lower-level and crossed random effect variances manifest as residual variance. Overall, our results show remarkable robustness of mixed-effects models that should allow researchers to use mixed-effects models even if the distributional assumptions are objectively violated. However, this does not free researchers from careful evaluation of the model. Estimates that are based on data that show clear violations of key assumptions should be treated with caution because individual datasets might give highly imprecise estimates, even if they will be unbiased on average across datasets.},

Relative quantification compares the expression of a target gene under two or more experimental conditions normalized to the measured expression of a control gene. The statistical methods and software currently available for the analysis of relative quantification of RT-PCR data lack the flexibility and statistical properties to produce valid inferences in a wide range of experimental situations. In this paper we present a novel method for the analysis of relative quantification of qRT-PCR data, which consists of the analysis of cycles to threshold values (C(T)) for a target and a control gene using a general linear mixed model methodology. Our method allows testing of a broader class of hypotheses than traditional analyses such as the classical comparative C(T). Moreover, a simulation study using plasmode datasets indicated that the estimated fold-change in pairwise comparisons was the same using either linear mixed models or a comparative C(T) method, but the linear mixed model approach was more powerful. In summary, the method presented in this paper is more accurate, powerful and flexible than the traditional methods for analysis of qRT-PCR data.

This article presents a detailed introduction to developing and interpreting linear mixed-effects models for repeated measurements in the setting of cardiothoracic surgery outcomes research.
METHODS: A retrospective dataset containing serial echocardiographic measurements in patients undergoing surgical pulmonary valve replacement from 1986 to 2017 in Erasmus MC was used to illustrate the steps of developing a linear mixed-effects model for clinician researchers.
RESULTS: Essential aspects of constructing the model are illustrated with the dataset including theories of linear mixed-effects models, missing values, collinearity, interaction, nonlinearity, model specification, results interpretation and assumptions evaluation. A comparison between linear regression models and linear mixed-effects models is done to elaborate on the strengths of linear mixed-effects models. An R script is provided for the implementation of the linear mixed-effects model.

	abstract = {Linear mixed-effect models (LMMs) are being increasingly widely used in psychology to analyse multi-level research designs. This feature allows LMMs to address some of the problems identified by Speelman and McGann (2013) about the use of mean data, because they do not average across individual responses. However, recent guidelines for using LMM to analyse skewed reaction time (RT) data collected in many cognitive psychological studies recommend the application of non-linear transformations to satisfy assumptions of normality. Uncritical adoption of this recommendation has important theoretical implications which can yield misleading conclusions. For example, Balota et al. (2013) showed that analyses of raw RT produced additive effects of word frequency and stimulus quality on word identification, which conflicted with the interactive effects observed in analyses of transformed RT. Generalized linear mixed-effect models (GLMM) provide a solution to this problem by satisfying normality assumptions without the need for transformation. This allows differences between individuals to be properly assessed, using the metric most appropriate to the researcher's theoretical context. We outline the major theoretical decisions involved in specifying a GLMM, and illustrate them by reanalysing Balota et al.'s datasets. We then consider the broader benefits of using GLMM to investigate individual differences.},

abstract = {Background
Network meta-analysis compares multiple treatments by incorporating direct and indirect evidence into a general statistical framework. One issue with the validity of network meta-analysis is inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence within a loop formed by three treatments. Recently, the inconsistency issue has been explored further and a complex design-by-treatment interaction model proposed.
Objective
The aim of this article was to show how to evaluate the design-by-treatment interaction model using the generalized linear mixed model.
Methods
We proposed an arm-based approach to evaluating the design-by-treatment inconsistency, which is flexible in modeling different types of outcome variables. We used the smoking cessation data to compare results from our arm-based approach with those from the standard contrast-based approach.
Results
Because the contrast-based approach requires transformation of data, our example showed that such a transformation may yield biases in the treatment effect and inconsistency evaluation, when event rates were low in some treatments. We also compared contrast-based and arm-based models in the evaluation of design inconsistency when different heterogeneity variances were estimated, and the arm-based model yielded more accurate results.
Conclusions
Because some statistical software commands can detect the collinearity among variables and automatically remove the redundant ones, we can use this advantage to help with placing the inconsistency parameters. This could be very useful for a network meta-analysis involving many designs and treatments.}
