# **Introduction to Linear Mixed-Effects Models (LMMs)**

Linear mixed-effects models (LMMs) are advanced statistical tools designed to analyze data that exhibit complex structures, such as hierarchical organization, repeated measures, and random effects. These models are particularly useful when data violate the assumptions of traditional ANOVA or regression methods, such as the independence of observations, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals. LMMs accommodate intra-subject differences, allowing for both fixed effects, which are consistent across individuals, and random effects, which vary among subjects or groups.

## **Implementation Methods**

The implementation of LMMs has been facilitated by various software packages and programming languages. Brown [@brown_introduction_2021] provides a comprehensive guide to implementing LMMs in R, a widely used statistical programming language, offering a step-by-step walkthrough of model syntax without delving deeply into complex mathematical foundations. Additionally, `Pymer4`, developed by Jolly [@jolly_pymer4_2018], bridges R and Python, offering Python users a flexible and integrated tool for linear mixed modeling by leveraging the capabilities of R's `lme4` package. This tool enhances the analytical capabilities within the Python ecosystem, making advanced statistical methods more accessible to a broader audience.

## **Industry-Specific Uses**

LMMs find applications across various scientific domains, each with its unique data structures and analytical challenges. Magezi [@magezi_linear_2015] highlights the use of LMMs in within-participant psychology experiments, addressing the complexities of repeated measures and nested data structures common in psychological research. Harrison Et. A. [@harrison_brief_2018] and Bolker Et. Al. [@bolker_generalized_2009] discuss the application of LMMs and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) in ecology, emphasizing their utility in analyzing ecological data that involve complex relationships and hierarchical data structures. In the medical field, LMMs are employed to model pandemic-induced mortality changes, as demonstrated by Verbeeck Et. Al. [@verbeeck_linear_2023], and to analyze longitudinal health-related quality of life data in cancer clinical trials, as discussed by Touraine Et. Al. \[@touraine_when_2023\].

## **Strengths and Weaknesses**

The strengths of LMMs lie in their flexibility to model complex data structures and their ability to handle missing data, making them a powerful tool for a wide range of scientific inquiries. However, their application is not without challenges. Peng and Lu [@peng_model_2012] address the difficulty of variable selection and parameter estimation in LMMs, proposing an iterative procedure to improve model accuracy. Barr [@barr_random_2013] critiques existing guidelines for testing interactions within LMMs, proposing new guidelines to ensure more reliable results. Despite their robustness, as noted by Schielzeth Et. Al. \[@schielzeth_robustness_2020\], LMMs require careful evaluation of model assumptions and may present computational challenges, especially with high-dimensional datasets.

## **Purpose**

This literature review collectively emphasize the versatility, robustness, and broad applicability of LMMs and GLMMs across various fields of research. Despite their advantages, the importance of careful model selection, acknowledgment of limitations, and the potential need for more complex models such as joint models in certain scenarios are also highlighted. As the use of LMMs continues to grow, the development of standardized processes and user-friendly tools will be crucial in ensuring the accurate and effective application of these models in research.
